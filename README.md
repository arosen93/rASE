rASE - Rosen revision to the Atomic Simulation Environment
=============================

ASE is a set of tools and Python modules for setting up, manipulating,
running, visualizing and analyzing atomistic simulations. 
The rASE repository is always up-to-date with the current build of ASE,
but it also includes changes I have made that have not made their way
to the main ASE repository. This repo is mostly just for my own benefit at this time,
so a detailed changelog is not provided.

Requirements
------------

* Python 2.7, 3.4-3.6
* NumPy

Optional:

* SciPy
* Matplotlib


Installation
------------

Add ``~/rASE`` to your $PYTHONPATH environment variable and add
``~/rASE/bin`` to $PATH (assuming ``~/rASE`` is where your rASE folder is).
